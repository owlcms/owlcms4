- [Issues and Feature Requests](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/issues)  See the Project Board below to see what we are working on. There are two ways to file an issue

  - The best way is to go to https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4 and use the Issue link at the top.  In this way, you get informed about the progress made and when the issue is closed.  Creating an account on GitHub is free.
  - If you prefer, send an e-mail to `owlcms@jflamy.dev` 

  When reporting a problem

  - Always state what version you are running
  - If at all possible, include an export of your database from the "Prepare Competition" page
  - Please use the Control Panel to go to the Files section of your version.  Locate the `logs` folder and include the log from the day the incident happened.
