The timekeeper screen is straightforward.  It allows starting/stopping the time, and resetting the clock to 1 or 2 minutes.

The timekeeper screen is often displayed on a tablet.  It works on iPhones, iPads and Android phones.

- if using the screen with a laptop, you can use the `,` (comma) key to start the timer, and the `.` (period) key to stop it.  This also means that you can connect a programmable button device to control the clock 
- The `*` key on the numeric keypad acts as a toggle (start if stopped, stop if started).
- The clock can be reset to 1:00 or 2:00 using the buttons, or by using the `-` and `=` keys respectively.
