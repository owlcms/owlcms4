- There are two options for you (you can do both)
  
  - Drag the owlcms icon to the Application icon.  This will copy the control panel app in your Application folder and you will find it there along with your other applications
  - Drag the owlcms icon to your desktop directly.


### Running OWLCMS

- After dragging the app to its location, **Right-click** on it. A warning about running an unsigned application will come up. **Select Open** to authorize the application to run.  *This is only needed the first time around.*

- Once this is done, you can follow the steps shown in the [Local Control Panel Overview](LocalControlPanel)
