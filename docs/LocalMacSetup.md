### Installation

- Download the `.dmg` installer by clicking on this link [macOS Installer](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-controlpanel/releases/latest/download/macOS_Control_Panel_Installer.dmg)

  - See this link for the [release notes](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-controlpanel/releases/latest)

- Open the `.dmg` file. 

- There are two options for you (you can do both if you want to)

  - Drag the owlcms icon to the Application icon.  This will copy the control panel app in your Application folder and you will find it there along with your other applications
  - Drag the owlcms icon to your desktop directly.

### Running OWLCMS

- **For macOS 14 and earlier**:
  - After dragging the app to its location, **Right-click** on it. A warning about running an unsigned application will come up. **Select Open** to authorize the application to run.  This is only needed the first time around.

- **For macOS 15**:
  - Try to run the program.  This will be denied.  The right-click shortcut no longer works.

  - Go to the  `System Settings` > `Privacy` menu.  Scroll to the bottom.  You should see an option to allow owlcms to run.  See this [illustrated guide](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Open_unsigned_applications_on_macOS_Sequoia) for the process -- you will of course use `owlcms` as the application name.

- Once this is done, you can follow the steps shown in the [Local Control Panel Overview](LocalControlPanel)
