 * <p>
 * A break type is either a countdown, or a ceremony taking place during a countdown. When a ceremony is taking place, a
 * countdown timer MUST be running with the state that we go to when the ceremony ends.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rule: because it is possible to hide/show the break dialog, the break timer shown on entry is the one already set or
 * running. So the timer must be set at the end of the previous break. E.g. end of BEFORE_INTRODUCTION sets
 * BEFORE_SNATCH 10:00 minutes as the duration, and pauses the timer.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Medals for group 1 before introduction of group 2, countdown started *after* medals
 *
 * <pre>
