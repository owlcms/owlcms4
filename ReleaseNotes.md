- Maintenance log
  - 54.2.1 If a weight change was made by one of the leaders lifting in the current session, the change was not visible on the lifter board.

  - 54.2.1 The information show to the jury about the previous attempt erroneously showed the weight on the attempt before that.
  
  - 54.2.1: Translations Armenian, Spanish (es_SV)
  
- QMasters
  - The QMasters score now uses the updated age factors for 2025

- Score-based Competitions
  -  Removed the "Sinclair Meet" option from the competition options.  Now replaced by [score-based medals](https://jflamy.github.io/owlcms4/#/ScoreBasedCompetitions).  To achieve the same, you can proceed as follows:
    - Create SM and SF age groups with ages 0-999 and only the default weight category.  Select "Already Gendered"

    - Select "Sinclair" or "Q-Points" or what you want as the scoring system. 

    - Unselect the traditional categories and reallocate athletes.

    - You can also create separate SM and SF for ages 0-34 and MM and MF for ages 35-999.  MM and MF would have SMHF or Q-masters as scoring system.  Same idea if you want youth categories to be score-based,  create additional YM and YF with Q-youth etc.
- Speaker
  - The updates to the lifting order grid are now synchronized with the notifications.  Previously the progression of an athlete could be visible for a moment, leading the speaker to believe the requested weight was going up to that amount.
- Age Groups and Championships
  - It is now possible to edit interactively the age group settings to define the championship in which the age groups belongs
  - It is now possible to define Championships interactively
  - It is now possible to define that an Age Group awards medals using a scoring system.
  - See the documentation for [score-based medals](https://jflamy.github.io/owlcms4/#/ScoreBasedCompetitions)
  - When changing age boundaries, or bodyweight boundaries, a confirmation is required if there are athletes already assigned to the age group.  This is because the old categories are no longer valid and must be removed. Therefore new categories must be selected for the athletes in the age group, which justifies the need for a confirmation.
  - AgeGroups definition files will now accept Sinclair, QMasters, QYouth, and SMHF as input for a scoring system (case does not matter), in addition to the legacy names (BW_Sinclair, QAGE, AGEFACTORS, SMM) 
  - When editing an athlete's registration data, categories will now be shown in "most specific order". Masters and IWF go before the Open (all ages) categories with bodyweights.  Score-based categories with no age and no bodyweight boundaries go last.
- Down Signal and Decisions
  - When using the decision display with keyboard (USB/joystick) devices, there was a *very remote* possibility that events could arrive out of order, causing the system to stay stuck on the down signal.  Now such reverting updates will be ignored.
- Scoreboards:
  - Now correctly display ranks and leaders for categories where medals are given based on a score 
  - Medals scoreboards and medals reports have now been fixed to handle score-based medals and sessions where both traditional and score-based medals are awarded.
  - Changing the medals display shown used for the video stream no longer changes the main screen
  - The "public" scoreboard meant to be used in the main room correctly switches during medal ceremonies
  - Interim scores: if the feature toggle `interimScores` is present, and an age group is using Sinclair or SM(H)F or Q-points for medals, then a score will be shown during snatch even it there is no total
- Results
  - During a competition with both score-based and total-based rankings, from the Competition Results page, using the Eligibility Categories report with the Score template will produce correct interim or final results.   Each category will be ranked according to it's scoring system.
  - Updated the competition results and the protocol sheets to use the faster jxls3 template processing. The categories are now listed in alphabetical order.
  - Athletes that did not weigh-in for their session no longer interfere with the determination that their categories are done and ready to receive medals.
  - In all results spreadsheets, a single best athlete score is shown to avoid controversies when the newer scoring systems give different results than the older ones.  
  - The best athlete system can be selected when producing the results (the default is set in the overall competition rules.) on all three types of documents.
- Templates:
  - the athlete's score and ranks in the current category are now obtained by using `${l.categoryScore}` `${l.categoryScoreRank}` (where l is the loop variable giving the current athlete).  
  - If the current category is not score-based,  the score is same as `${l.total}`and the rank is same as `${l.totalRank}`. It is therefore always possible to use the `Score` templates for a total-based competition.
  - added new properties 
    - ageGroup.sortCode and category.sortCodeWithAgeGroup for templates.  ageGroup.sortCode uses the code, max and min ages.  category.sortCodeWithAgeGroup adds the age group to the sort order - this is used when there are several open championships happening together.
    - athlete.gender.translatedGenderCode now returns the translation (for example, W instead of F)
    - athlete.sortedCategoriesAsString for use in emergency fixes to SBDE -- ensures main category is the most specific one.
    - athlete.sortedCategoriesAsString for fixing SBDE exports such that the main category is the most specific one
  - Removed the LEGAL paper size from the list.
- Bar Loading:
  - The weight under which collars are not used is now configurable.  Default is 40kg.
  - The normal grey bar color is used when 15kg bar is used for women or 20kg is used for men, even if the non-standard bar or children loading rules are in effect.
  -  Added a feature switch "usawCollars" to use collars if available except for U11 and U13 age groups (threshold is ignored)
- Documentation
  - Reorganized the structure for running a comp, updated screenshots

- Records
  - Exporting current records: It is now possible to export only the latest record for all the loaded records.  There are two types of templates: the ones that start with "export" can actually be loaded in the program. The ones that start with "report" have translated column headers are meant for readability -- you can upload them to a Google Sheet for example.
  - You can keep a historical master copy of the records by exporting all (which will include the successive improvements to a record).  You can reload this at every competition.
- Medals: Medals are ordered by age group.
  - Younger age groups first, presented in ascending bodyweight classes
  - 15-20 comes before 17-20, with an exception for "all ages" age groups: M85 Masters (85-999) comes before Open (0-999)
  - For age groups that have identical age ranges, groups with body weight categories before those that don't (score-based medals will be after the regular medals)
- Other
  -  IP addresses: if the network is using switches only with no DHCP server reachable, some servers may auto-configure with a link-local (169.254) address. Such addresses were previously hidden and will now be shown in the list.
  -  Experimental feature to stop or restart the system from the web interface.  Currently shown on the home page if the feature switch `manageOwlcms` is present.
  -  Ages are now always calculated relative to the competition date.
